## Overview
This repository serves as a reference for understanding and implementing low-level designs for real-world applications. Each system is designed considering scalability, maintainability, and extensibility.

---

## Projects

### Parking Lot System
A scalable parking lot management system that supports:
- Multiple parking levels
- Different vehicle types (bike, car, truck)
- Parking slot allocation and deallocation
- Fee calculation based on duration
- Admin and user roles

**Design Patterns Used:** Singleton, Factory, Strategy

ðŸ“Œ [View Implementation](https://github.com/manvi0308/LLD-MachineCoding/tree/main/src/ParkingLot)

---

### Vending Machine
A vending machine implementation supporting:
- Product selection
- Coin and note insertion
- Change return mechanism
- Inventory management
- State transitions (Idle, Ready, Dispense, ReturnChange)

**Design Patterns Used:** Singleton, State.

ðŸ“Œ [View Implementation](https://github.com/manvi0308/LLD-MachineCoding/tree/main/src/StateDesignPattern/VendingMachine)

---

### Publisher-Subscriber System
A distributed event-driven system that includes:
- Publishers sending messages/events
- Subscribers receiving relevant messages
- Message queues and asynchronous event handling

**Design Patterns Used:** Observer, Mediator

ðŸ“Œ [View Implementation](https://github.com/manvi0308/LLD-MachineCoding/tree/main/src/PubSubSystem)

---

### Car Booking System
A ride-booking system similar to Uber, featuring:
- User registration and authentication
- Ride booking and cancellation
- Driver assignment
- Payment processing

**Design Patterns Used:** Factory, Strategy, Observer

ðŸ“Œ [View Implementation](https://github.com/manvi0308/LLD-MachineCoding/tree/main/src/CarBookingSystem)
